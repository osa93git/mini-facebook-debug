# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Mini-Facebook – Recruitment Project

A minimal social networking platform inspired by the early version of Facebook. This project is being developed as a fullstack portfolio to showcase backend and frontend skills.

The application allows users to create accounts, browse profiles, and publish posts – all presented in a clean and minimalistic interface with a clear separation between backend and frontend layers.

The profile of user **Piotr Ossowski** is mine and serves as a personal showcase. Once the project is complete, it will be deployed on **Render.com**, and publicly accessible for exploring and account registration.
